##Description on how to use the app

This creates a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

##Requirements

* Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:
  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    * Train Name
    * Destination 
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  * Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
  * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.

##Technologies Used
* CSS 
* Javascript
* Jquery for Dom Manipulation
* Moment.js
